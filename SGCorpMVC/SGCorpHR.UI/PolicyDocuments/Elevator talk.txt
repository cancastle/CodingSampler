If any of you have experience with your own businesses, I would love to pick your brain!  
I am in the June .NET cohort, and I created a little business and a simple CD-ROM product 
in the 90s to fill a need in educational software.  I am also a K-16 teacher and have been 
experiencing another need for foreign language evaluations that my new skills can fill --have 
been doing market research as well as product design and will use it with students in my 
hometown school district this coming year.
