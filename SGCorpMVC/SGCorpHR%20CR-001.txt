SG Corp HR Portal
CR001 - Site Menu and Employee Suggestion Box

Summary:
As we continue to expand our HR portal application, we have decided that we need a way to keep
our portal organized for the users so we will need to add a menu to our site.  Additionally, we
want to have a way for for employees to submit suggestions for consideration.

Requirements:
1.  If you don't already have one, add a menu to the top of every page in the application. 

2.  Add "Resume" as the first menu item.  This should be a drop down with two options 
	("Upload Resume" & "View Resumes").  These will link to the pages you started previously.
	In some cases this may require that you refactor your code.  
	*Hint: Look for examples on how to create a dropdown menu at getbootstrap.com
	*Hint: Think about where you would implement your menu so that you only have to do it 
	once for all pages.
	
3.  Add another menu option for "Suggestions"
	Suggestions should have two options in a drop down menu ("Submit Suggestion" & "View Suggestions")
	Suggestions should be stored in a flat file database similar to what we used in the flooring
	mastery project.  They should include the following fields:  SuggestionID, EmployeeName, and 
	SuggestionText.  As the menu options suggest, we want a page to submit suggestions and one to
	view them.  We also want to be able to delete suggestions from the view page.

4.  Not all employees have access to the full HR portal.  We still want to allow them to submit suggestions.
	We need to be able to give these employees a link to the Submit Suggestion page.  Add a route
	configuration to have a url that looks something like:  <localhost:port>/suggestion
	This should load the page.  Since we are not actually implementing security at this point, don't 
	worry that the menu is available.  We can restrict this at a later time.
