SG Corp HR Portal
CR003 - Time Tracking

Summary:
In order to keep a more accurate accounting of time each employee is working, the HR
department has requested a self-service time tracking page in the HR Portal.  This will
start as a simple time tracking page but will give us a basis to add additional features
as time goes on.

Requirements:
1.	Add "Time Tracking" as a top level menu item.  This should be a dropdown menu with the 
	following options: 
		* Submit Time
		* View Timesheet
		
2.	The Submit Time page will be a simple form to submit a time entry.  The following fields
	should be on the form:
		* Employee (dropdown with each employee's Last, First names as the text and EmpID as 
		  the value).
		* Date (This should be a datepicker field) *Hint: remember we can decorate the
		  properties in our model to indicate the data type and use @Html.EditorFor()
		* Hours Worked (This is just a textbox that accepts a decimal value should not be able
		  to submit more than 16 hours in a single entry).
	Upon Submission of the Form, the user should be redirected to the View Timesheet page.

3.	The View Timesheet page will have a dropdown list at the top that allows the user to select
	which employee (similar to the one on the submit page) to view time for.  After the user 
	selects an employee, it will load a summary section at the top that shows the employee name, 
	hire date and total hours worked to date.  Below the summary section, there will be a grid
	that lists all of the time entry records for this employee with the newest first.  There will
	be a button on each row to allow the user to delete a single time entry.  This should cause the
	page to refresh and show updated an summary at the top.
	
Items not in scope:  
1.  We will not have a way in this iteration to edit a time entry record.
