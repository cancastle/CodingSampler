SG Corp HR Portal
CR002 - Policy Document Library

Summary:
The HR department has a number of policy documents that employees need to refer to from time to
time and they would like to make these available on the HR portal site for employees to be able
to view at will.  They would also like to have the ability to manage these by adding new ones as 
needed and deleting obsolete documents.

Requirements:
1.	Add "Policy Documents" as a top level menu item.  This should be a dropdown with two options.  
	The first options should be "View Documents" and the second should be "Manage Documents".
	
2.	The manage documents page will allow an HR representative to either click a link to add a new
	document or select a category from a dropdown list and then view the list of documents available 
	in that category.  From the list, the user should have the ability to delete a document.

3.	The add document page will allow an HR representative to either select an existing category or
	enter a new category for the document.  There should also be a file upload control to save the 
	document.
	
4.  The View Documents page should have a way to select a category. Once the user selects a category, 
	a list of all the documents in that category will be displayed for the user.  The user should
	be able to click on a document to be able to open it.
